        "The MediaPipe object detection solution provides several models you can use immediately for machine learning (ML) in your application. However, if you need to detect objects not covered by the provided models, you can customize any of the provided models with your own data and MediaPipe Model Maker. This model modification tool rebuilds the model using data you provide. This method is faster than training a new model and can produce a model that is more useful for your specific application.\n",

You can do this by trimming down a public dataset to only the classes that are relevant to your usecase, compiling your own dataset, or some combination of both, The dataset can be significantly smaller than what would be required to train a new model. For example, the [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/) dataset used to train many reference models contains hundreds of thousands of images with 91 classes of objects. Transfer learning with Model Maker can retrain an existing model with a smaller dataset and still perform well, depending on your inference accuracy goals.

        "* The android figurines dataset is a small and simple dataset with 62 training examples and 10 validation examples. Since the dataset is quite small, metrics may vary drastically due to variances in the training process. This dataset was provided for demo purposes and it is recommended to collect more data samples for better performing models.\n",
